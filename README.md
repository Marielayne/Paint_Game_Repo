# Paint_Game_Repo
## My Summative Assessment Two Submission
### Introduction 
At AkzoNobel we manufacture paints and coatings for a wide range of industries and customers. Such examples include manufacturing coatings for ships which need to be durable against marine life and conditions, coatings for aeroplanes, paints and primers for vehicles including specialised vehicles such as McLarens Formula 1 car, interior and exterior wall paints that have different purposes and functionality. As a result of the high demand industries that we work in, a deep knowledge and understanding of how paint is formulated is required. We strive to provide the best performance to provide us with an edge over competitors which reducing the environmental impact. 

The department in which we work focuses on interior wall paint primarily used for customers to use on home projects or for small businesses such as decorators. To do this we experiment with the formulations to improve test results or environmental impact. This GUI is a simple way to test new employees understanding of our tests and performance indicators. For instance, the quiz will ask basic questions such as “what is opacity”. The assumption is the new starts would have been trained on this prior and thus, should know the correct answers (multiple choice). However, for those who have not been trained or need support, the answers are available online. The GUI saves the data to a csv file and takes the names of participants. This provides employers with evidence of understanding from the training and peace of mind to allow them to begin creating and testing paint formulations. For the sake of this repo, questions have been kept minimal and general to prevent leaking trade secrets.
